# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

### Pokemon Exploratory Analysis
What I like most about data visualisation is being able to use colour shape and form to tell a story as convention or unconventional it can be.

### Data description
 Here I will preovide a brief explaination into what each features pof the dataset represemt.
 The following features used in this data are:
 * Name
   - Essentially the name of the Pokemon this will be particularly usesful when identitfying specific Pokemon. Data type = string.
 * Type 1:
   - The forst type of Pokemon categorical data. All Pokemon have a type 1. Data type= String
 * Type 2:
    - Second type of Pokemon not all Pokemon have two types similarly to Type 1 this is categorical data. Data type = string.
 * HP,	Attack,	Defense,	Sp.Atk,	Sp.Def,	Speed
    - These are numerical features each feature varies by each Pokemon and are use to describe the Pokemon psyhical abilities.
 * Generation
    - This describes what release/ group of Pokemon it belongs to. The categorical data describes how new to old the Pokemon is. 1= Older 6 = Newer.
 * Legendary
    - This boolean categorical feature denotes whether the Pokemon if Legendary or not. Typically legemdaru Pokemon are rarer.
